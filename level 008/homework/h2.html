     <h3><p>The Porsche 911 model series (pronounced Nine Eleven or in German: Neunelf) is a family of German two-door,<br> high performance rear-engine sports cars, introduced in September 1964 by Porsche AG of Stuttgart, Germany.<br> Now in its eighth generation, all 911s have a rear-mounted flat-six engine, and usually 2+2 seating, except for special 2-seater variants.<br> Originally, 911s had air-cooled engines, and torsion bar suspension, but the 911 has been continuously enhanced, and evolved across generations.<br> Though the 911 core concept has remained largely unchanged, water-cooled engines were introduced with the 996 series in 1998,<br> and front and rear suspension have been replaced by Porsche-specific MacPherson suspension up front,<br> and independent multi-link rear suspension.</p></h3>
