The engine is front-mid mounted and drives all four wheels.<br> It succeeds the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a high-performance variant of the Nissan Skyline. <br>Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up.<br> The car is built on the PM platform, derived from the FM platform used in the Skyline and Nissan Z models.<br> Production is conducted in a shared production line at Nissan's Tochigi plant in Japan.</p></h3>
